# My Claude Code Workflow

A comprehensive development workflow configuration for Claude Code, designed to enhance productivity and maintain code quality through intelligent agent coordination and systematic development practices.

## Overview

This repository contains a curated set of development guidelines, agent configurations, and workflow optimizations specifically designed for use with Claude Code. It emphasizes incremental development, intelligent knowledge gathering, and maintaining high code quality standards.

## Key Features

### ðŸ§  Intelligent Knowledge Gathering
- **knowledge-scout agent** for systematic research and information gathering
- Prioritizes authoritative sources and cached knowledge graphs
- Supports concurrent research operations for maximum efficiency

### ðŸ“‹ Structured Development Process
- **Incremental progress over big bangs** - Small, testable changes
- **Stage-based planning** with clear success criteria
- **3-attempt rule** for debugging and problem-solving

### ðŸŽ¯ Quality-First Approach
- Test-driven development practices
- Comprehensive code quality gates
- Automated linting and formatting requirements

## Structure

```

â”œâ”€â”€ CLAUDE.md              # Main development guidelines and instructions
â”œâ”€â”€ .claude/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ agents/

## Core Philosophy

### Development Principles
- **Learning from existing code** - Study patterns before implementing
- **Pragmatic over dogmatic** - Adapt to project reality
- **Clear intent over clever code** - Be boring and obvious
- **Single responsibility** per function/class

### Quality Standards
- Every commit must compile and pass tests
- Include tests for new functionality
- Follow project formatting/linting standards
- Clear commit messages explaining "why"

## Quick Install

### One-Line Installation

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/layue13/MyClaudeCodeWorkflow/raw/main/ccw.sh | bash
```

This will install the workflow configuration globally to your `~/.claude/` directory.

### Manual Installation

```bash
# Download the installer
wget https://github.com/layue13/MyClaudeCodeWorkflow/raw/main/ccw.sh

# Make it executable and run
chmod +x ccw.sh
./ccw.sh install
```

### What Gets Installed

The installer copies the following files to your global Claude configuration:

```
~/.claude/
â”œâ”€â”€ CLAUDE.md              # Development guidelines and best practices
â””â”€â”€ agents/
    â””â”€â”€ knowledge-scout.md # Intelligent research agent configuration
```

### After Installation

Once installed, the workflow is automatically available in all your projects. Simply use Claude Code normally:

```bash
cd your-project
claude "help me implement user authentication"
```

The workflow will automatically:
- Break complex tasks into manageable stages
- Use knowledge-scout for technical research
- Follow TDD development practices
- Learn from your existing codebase patterns

### Management Commands

```bash
# Update to latest version
./ccw.sh update

# Remove the workflow
./ccw.sh uninstall
```

## Getting Started

1. **Install the workflow** - Use the one-line installer above
2. **Review CLAUDE.md** - Understand the development guidelines
3. **Start coding** - Use Claude Code with enhanced workflow capabilities

## Usage

The workflow is designed to be used with Claude Code's agent system. Key practices include:

- **Planning & Staging**: Break complex work into 3-5 manageable stages
- **Implementation Flow**: Understand â†’ Test â†’ Implement â†’ Refactor â†’ Commit
- **Knowledge Gathering**: Use knowledge-scout agent for research needs
- **Quality Gates**: Ensure tests pass and code follows conventions

## Agent Configuration

### knowledge-scout
Specialized agent for systematic information gathering:
- Research technical concepts and frameworks
- Investigate current best practices
- Verify information from authoritative sources
- Support concurrent research operations

## Contributing

When working with this workflow:

1. Follow the development guidelines in CLAUDE.md
2. Use the knowledge-scout agent for research needs
3. Maintain the incremental development approach
4. Ensure all quality gates are met before committing
