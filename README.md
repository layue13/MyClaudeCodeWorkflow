# My Claude Code Workflow

A comprehensive development workflow configuration for Claude Code, designed to enhance productivity and maintain code quality through intelligent agent coordination and systematic development practices.

## Overview

This repository contains a curated set of development guidelines, agent configurations, and workflow optimizations specifically designed for use with Claude Code. It emphasizes incremental development, intelligent knowledge gathering, and maintaining high code quality standards.

## Key Features

### ðŸ§  Intelligent Knowledge Gathering
- **knowledge-scout agent** for systematic research and information gathering
- Prioritizes authoritative sources and cached knowledge graphs
- Supports concurrent research operations for maximum efficiency

### ðŸ“‹ Structured Development Process
- **Incremental progress over big bangs** - Small, testable changes
- **Stage-based planning** with clear success criteria
- **3-attempt rule** for debugging and problem-solving

### ðŸŽ¯ Quality-First Approach
- Test-driven development practices
- Comprehensive code quality gates
- Automated linting and formatting requirements

## Core Philosophy

### Development Principles
- **Learning from existing code** - Study patterns before implementing
- **Pragmatic over dogmatic** - Adapt to project reality
- **Clear intent over clever code** - Be boring and obvious
- **Single responsibility** per function/class

### Quality Standards
- Every commit must compile and pass tests
- Include tests for new functionality
- Follow project formatting/linting standards
- Clear commit messages explaining "why"

## Getting Started

1. **Review CLAUDE.md** - Understand the development guidelines
2. **Configure agents** - Set up the knowledge-scout agent
3. **Follow the process** - Use the structured development flow
4. **Maintain quality** - Ensure all quality gates are met

## Usage

The workflow is designed to be used with Claude Code's agent system. Key practices include:

- **Planning & Staging**: Break complex work into 3-5 manageable stages
- **Implementation Flow**: Understand â†’ Test â†’ Implement â†’ Refactor â†’ Commit
- **Knowledge Gathering**: Use knowledge-scout agent for research needs
- **Quality Gates**: Ensure tests pass and code follows conventions

## Agent Configuration

### knowledge-scout
Specialized agent for systematic information gathering:
- Research technical concepts and frameworks
- Investigate current best practices
- Verify information from authoritative sources
- Support concurrent research operations

## Contributing

When working with this workflow:

1. Follow the development guidelines in CLAUDE.md
2. Use the knowledge-scout agent for research needs
3. Maintain the incremental development approach
4. Ensure all quality gates are met before committing
